# Step-by-Step Guide: Building a Customer Management Application
# 1. Project Setup
      Create Spring Boot Project:
           Use Spring Initializr or your IDE to create a new Spring Boot project.
           Include dependencies for Spring Web and PostgreSQL.
      Database Setup:
           Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running locally.
           Create a new database for the application.

# 2. Define Entity and Repository
      Create Customer Entity:
            Define a Customer entity class with attributes:
               customerId, name, lastName, and mobile.
            Annotate the class with @Entity and define appropriate fields.
      Customer Repository:
            Develop a CustomerRepository interface extending JpaRepository<Customer, Long>.
   
Use this interface for CRUD operations on the Customer entity.
# 3. Service Layer Implementation
      Customer Service:
            Create a CustomerService class with methods for CRUD operations.
            Autowire the CustomerRepository for database operations.
            Implement methods like createCustomer, getCustomerById, getCustomerList, and updateCustomer.
# 4. Controller Setup
      Customer Controller:
            Develop a CustomerController class annotated with @RestController.
            Define endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and listing customers.
            Map these endpoints to appropriate methods in the CustomerService.
# 5. Configuration
      Database Configuration:
            Configure the application.properties file with PostgreSQL database connection details.
            Set up the database URL, username, password, and other necessary properties.
# 6. Testing and Execution
      Testing APIs:
           Run the Spring Boot application.
           Use tools like Postman to test the APIs created:
           Test /v1/create to add new customers.
           Check /v1/getById to fetch customer details.
           Explore /v1/getAll to retrieve a list of customers.
           Test /v1/update to modify customer details.

# Conclusion
By following these steps, you'll have developed a Customer Management Application using Java 1.8, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL.
Ensure to adapt and enhance the application based on specific requirements and business needs.
